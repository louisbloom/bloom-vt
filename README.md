# bloom-vt

A standalone virtual terminal engine in C — parser, grid, scrollback, reflow,
charsets, kitty keyboard protocol — with no external dependencies. Extracted
from [bloom-terminal](https://github.com/thomas-christensen/bloom-terminal),
where it replaces libvterm.

## What it does

- **VT100 / VT220 / xterm parser** — CSI / OSC / DCS / ESC dispatch, DEC
  modes, scrolling regions, charsets (incl. DEC special graphics line
  drawing), origin mode, tab-stop manipulation (TBC).
- **UAX-aware grid** — Unicode #11 East Asian Width and #29 grapheme
  cluster widths computed at insertion time and stored on each cell.
  ZWJ sequences, regional indicators, skin-tone modifiers, and VS16
  emoji presentation all carry the right cell width without
  per-renderer peek-ahead.
- **Grapheme arena** — full clusters are interned; cells reference them
  by id, so there is no hardcoded codepoint cap (libvterm caps at 6).
- **Scrollback** — paged ring buffer; default 1000 lines, configurable.
- **Reflow** — recomputes wrap on resize; preserves cursor row.
- **Kitty keyboard protocol** — flags 0x1 (Disambiguate) and 0x8 (Report
  all keys as escape codes) are fully implemented. Push/pop/set/query
  of the flag stack works. Flags 0x2/0x4/0x10 are accepted on the stack
  but currently no-ops (waiting on a concrete consumer).
- **Zero external dependencies** — libc only.

divergences, and the deferred items — see [`FOLLOWUPS.md`](FOLLOWUPS.md).

## Memory model

Bounded allocation and a zero-allocation steady-state hot path are explicit
design goals. Concretely:

- **Pluggable allocator.** All heap traffic goes through a `BvtAllocator`
  (malloc/realloc/free function pointers) supplied at `bvt_new()` time.
  Callers can route everything to an arena, a pool, or a tracked allocator
  without patching the library. Pass `NULL` to use libc.
- **Paged grids.** Each `BvtPage` owns a contiguous cell buffer plus a
  per-row flag byte. A terminal has at most two pages live at once (the
  primary grid and, while in altscreen, the alternate). Page allocation
  happens on `bvt_new`, on resize, and on altscreen entry — never from
  `bvt_input_write`.
- **Paged scrollback.** A doubly linked ring of pages, 64 rows per page,
  default 1000 lines total. Allocations happen only when a page fills; the
  ring evicts the oldest page when capacity is reached, so scrollback
  memory is bounded by the configured line count regardless of input.
- **Per-page interning.** A style intern table keyed by SGR pen and a
  grapheme arena keyed by codepoint sequence both live on the page.
  Cells store a 32-bit `style_id` and 32-bit `grapheme_id`, so repeated
  styles and clusters cost one slot regardless of how many cells use them.
  Single-codepoint clusters use `cp` directly with `grapheme_id == 0` and
  hit the arena zero times. Unlike libvterm's hard-coded 6-codepoint cell
  cap, clusters here are arbitrary length.
- **Hot path.** `bvt_input_write` does no allocation in steady state —
  all hot-path structures (parser scratch, OSC accumulator up to 4 KiB,
  cursor cluster buffer up to 16 codepoints) are inline in `BvtTerm`.
  The intern tables grow geometrically and amortize to zero; the grapheme
  arena reuses existing entries on hash hit.
- **Lifecycle.** `bvt_new` / `bvt_free` is the only ownership pair the
  consumer manages. `bvt_free` releases every page, intern table, arena,
  and tab-stop bitmap through the same allocator that produced them.

`BvtTerm` itself is not internally synchronized; callers own all locking.

## Build and install

Standard GNU autotools workflow:

```sh
./autogen.sh                                # writes ./version, runs autoreconf -fi
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
make
make check
make install
```

Optional targets:

```sh
make format       # clang-format on src/, include/, tests/; prettier on *.md
make bear         # produce compile_commands.json for clangd
make distcheck    # build, test, and verify the dist tarball is self-contained
```

## Linking

```sh
cc app.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs bloom-vt)
```

`bloom-vt.pc` installs to `${libdir}/pkgconfig/`.

## Minimal usage

```c
#include <bloom-vt/bloom_vt.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    BvtTerm *vt = bvt_new(24, 80);  /* 24 rows x 80 cols */

    const char *bytes = "hello\033[31m world\033[0m\n";
    bvt_input_write(vt, (const uint8_t *)bytes, strlen(bytes));

    int rows, cols;
    bvt_get_dimensions(vt, &rows, &cols);
    for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
        const BvtCell *cell = bvt_get_cell(vt, 0, c);
        if (!cell || cell->width == 0) continue;
        putchar(cell->cp ? (int)cell->cp : ' ');
    }
    putchar('\n');

    bvt_free(vt);
    return 0;
}
```
